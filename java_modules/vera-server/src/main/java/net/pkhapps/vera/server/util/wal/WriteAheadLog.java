/// Interface for an application-scoped write-ahead-log.

/// General principles:
/// - Any component can append events to it, which will be written into the log serially.
/// - Replays and snapshots are handled centrally by the WAL implementation.
/// - Any component can register itself as an event consumer. When the log is replayed, the consumer receives a callback.
/// - Any component can register itself as a snapshot consumer. When the log is replayed, the consumer receives a callback.
/// - Any component can register itself as a snapshot producer. When the log decides to make a snapshot, the producer receives a callback.
